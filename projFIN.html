        <p>This documentary centers around Dr. Luis Mojica of the <a class="MMG" href="https://multiculturalmusic.org/" target="_blank">Multicultural Music Group.</a> 
            <br>
            The Multicultural Music Group (or MMG) is a non-profit organization dedicated to the education and diversification of musical education in the New York area. 
            Based in the Bronx for over 20 years, the MMG focuses on the education of middle and high school students in a multitude of instruments, genres, and techniques.
            As the Executive Director of the MMG for over 20 years, Dr. Mojica is extremely passionate about the group's mission to educate and present music from all over the world. 
           
            However, with changing times and education inequality on the rise, Mojica discusses the ways in which the MMG is struggling to branch out, and how the educational system in the US needs to change.
            For this documentary we went to Dr. Mojica's home which also acts as MMG Headquarters to discuss the history and mission of the group as well as looking at past programs. Sitting down with Dr. Mojica was an insightful discussion. I learned so much in the few hours we were with him and really understood his passion for music and education. 
            Additionally, we used archival footage from their shows to present the main goal of the organization, presentation of different cultures. 
            <br>
            This was an extremely compelling and educational documentary to make. I learned so much making this documentary and am extremely grafteful for Dr. Mojica for his time and attention.
