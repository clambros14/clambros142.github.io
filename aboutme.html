        <p class="about"><b>Hello!</b> 
            <br><br>
        My name is Caitlin and I'm a 20-year-old undergraduate at Fordham University. I'm studying Film & Television with a double major in Journalism.
        <br>
        I was born and raised in Baltimore, MD but have always dreamed of moving to NYC. Along with this I always dreamed of being in the film industry, even attending a highly-competitive arts high school to heighten my abilities. 
        <br>
        I currently work as the Assistant to the Technical Director of Fordham's Theatre program. In my spare time, I'm often creating and developing new film ideas and short projects. Additionally, I'm a contributing writer and have been published with the <a href="https://fordhamobserver.com/staff_name/caitlin-lambros/" target="_blank"><i>Fordham Observer</i></a>. 
        <br>
        And to get to know a little bit more about me... My Letterboxd top four films are Ferris Bueller's Day Off, Knives Out, Aftersun, and Perks of Being a Wallflower. Follow me <a href="https://boxd.it/J1h9" target="_blank">here.</a></p>
